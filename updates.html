				<p class="editable"><b>Practice collection of Salmonberry specimens in Bellevue, WA</b>We collected the specimens, cleaned them and froze them in dry ice and isopropyl alcohol mix. This stops all cell activity to halt the RNA production and degradation instantly. This can be done by putting the specimens in liquid nitrogen and storing at -80 C. We did not have access to a -80 C freezer so this was a practice run. We were able to collect berries, flower petals, leaves, stem, and root pieces.</p>

				<p class="editable"><b>Collection at Grass Lawn Park in Redmond, WA:</b> 
We collected berries, flower petals, leaves, stem and root pieces. We washed them, chopped them, and preserved them in vials with RNALater.  RNALater allows storage at -20 C without degradation.</p>

				<p class="editable">We came across two different types of Salmonberry bushes at Grass Lawn Park, and this could be interesting to look into next spring.</p>

				<p class="editable">A big thank you to our sponsors who funded the collection materials and RNALater.</p>

				<p class="editable"><b>Collaboration established with Dr. Madzima:</b> Dr. Thelma Madzima from University of Washington, Bothell graciously volunteered to support our project by providing us the space for our molecular biology research and her expertise in plant molecular biology. Dr. Madzimaâ€™s research is currently funded by the UW Bothell, School of STEM.</p>
