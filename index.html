				<h2 class="editable">Why salmonberry?</h2>
				<p class="editable">In the beautiful Pacific Northwest, we have a rich ethnobotany and many native plants with fascinating medical uses.</p>
				<p class="editable"><a href="http://www.goodfoodworld.com/2012/12/salmonberry-food-medicine-culture/">Salmonberries are one such plant. </a>
									As a member of the Rubus genus, are related to blackberries and raspberries, ancient plants originally brought to North America across the Bering Land Bridge. </p>
				<p class="editable">We chose the salmonberry specifically not just because we love our local fruit, but also because it lets us ask new scientific questions.</p>
				<p class="editable">The salmonberry has not been studied as extensively as the raspberry or blackberry, so we can make new comparisons with other plants that have related medicinal uses.</p>

				<h2 class="editable">Why RNA sequencing?</h2>
				<p class="editable">RNA sequencing allows us to study transcriptome. The transcriptome shows the genes that are actively being expressed among the many unused genes that exist in every genome. 
									This provides insights into what proteins the cell is making, and can be used to compare the gene expression between different plants, as well as different parts of the same plant.
									Knowing why the plant produces various proteins and what other gene activity is occurring can give valuable information about the plant's medical and nutritional properties.</p>

				<h2 class="editable">Why are we raising money?</h2>
				<p class="subtext editable">While we look forwards to doing all of this analysis on the genome, we need to pay for getting the actually sequencing done. Please follow our progress and support us on Indigogo.</p>
				<p class="subtext editable">We are a Washington state nonprofit, and all money goes towards the project. Deposits can also be made directly to our bank account (info here).
